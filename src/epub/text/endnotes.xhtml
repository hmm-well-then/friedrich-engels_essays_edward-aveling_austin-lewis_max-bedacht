					<p>Engels is applying here the word labor in its old usage in place of labor power. In later years Engels and Marx always put labor power in places where labor was used in this sense before.</p>
					<p>“In order to be able to extract value from the consumption of a commodity, our friend, Moneybags, must be so lucky as to find, within the sphere of circulation, in the market, a commodity, whose use-value possesses the peculiar property of being a source of value, whose actual consumption, therefore, is itself an embodiment of labor, and, consequently, a creation of value. The possessor of money does find on the market such a special commodity in capacity for labor or labor power.” Marx: Capital, Vol. 1, p. 186.</p>

					<p>Manufacture is used here in a now obsolete sense meaning production by hand (Latin: manus⁠—hand and facio⁠—make.) Manufacture was the firast form of industrialization of production In the pre-machine age, the organization of production by hand on a large scale as against individual production under the gulld system. Manufacture was the forerunner of modern machine industry. Wherever used in this document the word has this meaning.</p>

					<p>The indispensable minimum of subsistence mentioned here is not the absolute minimum on which a worker can keep alive. The minimum cited here as the determining factor of the value of labor power includes also such things as would be considered luxurles in a backward country but are self-understood necessities in a highly developed country. Thus the value of the commodity, labor power, varies in the different countries.</p>
					<p>Marx says about this in “Capital” Vol. 1, Chapter VI:</p>
					<p>“If the owner of labor-power works today, tomorrow he must again be able to repeat the same process in the same conditions as regards health and strength. His means of subsistence must therefore be sufficient to maintain him in his normal state as a laboring individual. His natural wants, such as food, clothing, fuel, and housing, vary according to the climate and other physical conditions of his country. On the other hand, the number and extent of his so-called necessary wants, as also the modes of satisfying them, are themselves the product of historical development, and depend therefore to a great extent on the conditions under which, and consequently on the habits and degree of comfort in which, the class of free laborers has been formed. In contra-distinction therefore to the case of other commodities, there enters into the determination of the value of labor-power, a historical and moral element.”</p>

					<p>Answer to question 9.</p>
					<p>The journeyman of the guildmaster was, as a rule, the apprentice of yesterday and the master of tomorrow, while the modern proletarian is, as a rule, a wage worker for life. The journeyman of the artisan lived as a part of the famlily of the latter and was part of the same social strata, while the proletarian is divided from his employer by a social chasm which removes him, in education, in mode of living, etc. a whole world from the capitalist. The journeyman of the artisan worked with tools that were his property, or, at least, easily became his property: the proletarian manipulates a machine, not his own and beyond his power to buy⁠—firstly, because he lacks the necessary means, and, secondly, the machine is practically useless except as a part of a whole system of machines that make up the factory and permit the production of a commodity only by their common or successive use. The journeyman of the independent artisan was an artisan himself; the quality of his product dependent on his skill; the modern proletarian is a machine hand: the quality of his product depends mostly on the machine while he is responsible for the quantity. The journeyman and his master, the guild burgher, were protected against competition by monopolistic guild charters: the proletarian of today is a plaything of competition. The journeyman and his guildmaster were reactionary and resisted economic progress because it destroyed their idylllc monopolist existence; the proletarian of today welcomes and assists economic progress because his final emancipation is dependent on the furtherest possible development of all the productive forces of society.</p>

					<p>Bourgeois democracy made its bow to society with a very limited suffrage. Voting was a privilege of the propertied classes. A change has taken place slowly. Since Engels wrote this manuscript, bourgeois democracy has undergone a gradual change in outward form. With education, the press and pulpit under its absolute control, capitalism could entrust the masses with the right to vote. Occasional interference in the calculations of the ruling groups by uncontrollable moods of the voters is met with little correctives such as graft and corruption. A system of checks and balances is a protection against any undesirable sudden political changes. And againat any danger of a serious political revolt there always remains, for a corrective, the police and military power of the state. Thus it is not only the limitation of the suffrage to the bourgeoisie which assures unrestricted and unqualified political control to that class.</p>
					<p>However, at the time when Engels wrote this document the question of extension of suffrage was a revolutionary demand of large masses in France and England. It waa for this reason that the author of the “Principles” emphasized the importance of limited suffrage for bourgeois control of the state.</p>

					<p>The right of parliaments to grant taxes is the foundation of tremendous power, even in a pseudo constitutional monarchy, such as Germany was before the world war. The dependency of the government on parliament for its only steadily yielding source of income, taxes and tariffs, etc., forces even the semi-feudal monarchy into the role of a servant to the bourgeoisie. The monarch claiming to rule by the grace of God sinks into the position of a lackey of capitalism, reigning by the grace of the bourgeolisie.</p>
					<p>Capitalism, however, at the same time, changes the economic basis of the old nobility and thus turns it into a subdivision of the modern capitalist class representing mostly agrarian capital.</p>

					<p>Engels wrote this manuscript on the eve of a revolutionary upheaval, the shadow of which was visible to his keen eyes even then. His enthusiastic welcome for the coming event was caused in the main by his conviction that a new revolution, in France for instance, could make its appearance only as a proletarian revolution. Even in backward Germany the national revolution then due, could, in his eyes, only complete its task of creating a democratic national state. With this accomplished, the bourgeois revolution would have dug its own grave into which it would be pushed unceremoniously by its energetic successor, the proletarian revolution. Marx shared these expectations.</p>
					<p>This optimistic hope was not well founded. Engels himgelf wrote about this view a half century later:</p>
					<p>“History proved us and all those that thought like we did to have been incorrect. It has made clear that the stage of economic development on the continent was by far, not ripe at that time for the elimination of capitalist production. It has proven this by the economic revolution which since 1848, has taken hold of the whole continent and has only since then granted real citizenship to big industry in France, Austria, Hungary, Poland and lately also Russia, and which has made Germany absolutely an industrial country of the first order⁠—all on a capitaliat basis which in 1848 surely was still able to expand very much. It is just this industrial revolution that has brought clarity into the relation of the classes; which has eliminated a great number of intermediary groups that have come over from the manufacturing period and, in Eastern Europe, even from the artisans; which has created a real bourgeoisie and a real proletariat and has pushed these classes into the foreground of the stage of social development. It is by this process that the struggles between these two great classes, which in 1848 existed, outside of England, only in Paris, and at best in a few big industrial centers, has been spread all over Europe and has taken on an intensity which was unthinkable in 1848. Then, the many sectarian ‘gospels’ with thelr panaceas⁠—today. the generally accepted, transparently clear, and its last aim clearly defining theory of Marx. Then, the masses divided into, and differing by, localities and natlonalities, thrown back and forth between enthusiasm and despair⁠—today, a great international army of Communists⁠—marching onward irresistibly growing daily in numbers, in organization, in discipline, in understanding and in its conviction of victory.”</p>

					<p>Engels never entertained any illusions about the possibilities of a peaceful revolution. In the foreword to “Civil Wars in France,” Engels says: “The working class cannot confine itself to taking possession of a ready made governmental state machinery and setting it going for its own ends.” Or as Marx puts it: “The proletarian revolution has not to transmit the military and bureaucratic machinery from one hand to another as has been done up to the present, but must break it.”</p>
					<p>If in spite of that, Engels does not deny categorically all chances of a peaceful revolution it is because he did not want to frighten unnecessarily his newly won adherents of the Paris club. Although they had dethroned their leaders, who were moved by illusions rather than by knowledge, they had not yet dethroned their own illusions. Engels therefore presents armed conflicts as an historic probability declaring the Communists to meet the emergency when it arises. Thus he did justice to his convictions and yet did not frighten his new friends beyond the boundary lines of his influence.</p>
					<p>In the Manifesto the two friends did no longer make such concessions. There they say:</p>
					<p>“The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that thelr ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a Communistic revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but thelr chains. They have a world to win.</p>
					<p>“Working men of all countries, unite!”</p>

					<p>The paragraph abruptly ends in the original work. This uncited endnote probably goes here:</p>
					<p>“Comparing the draft of Engels with the final form of the Manifesto, it will be noted that the Manifesto proposes more radical measures than the draft. The draft suggests limitation of inheritance, the Manifesto demands abolitlon: the draft proposes expropriation of land gradually and for compensation, the Manifesto demands immediate and complete expropriation without compensation. Public organization of work and erection of palaces of labor has been dropped entirely by the Manifesto.</p>
					<p>“Engels was influenced in some of his immediate demands by existing tendencies in France, by Louis Blanc and others.</p>
					<p>“For Engels, the demand for a democratic constitution did not express the form of proletarian rule but a condition permitting the organization of the proletariat for political struggle for the setting up of a proletarian dictatorship. Criticizing the name Social-Democrats in 1894, Engels said: ‘Social-Democrat⁠ ⁠… is inexact as a name for a party whose economic program is not simply a general socialist one, but definitely Communist⁠—for a party whose political aim is the suppression of the state and, therefore, also democracy.’</p>

					<p>The Communist Manifesto answers this question as follows:</p>
					<p>“Natlonal differances, and antagonisms between peoples, are daily more and more vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of commerce, to the world-market, to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.</p>
					<p>“The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. United action, of the leading civilized countries at least, is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.</p>
					<p>“In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.”</p>

					<p>About religion and Communism we read in the Communist Manifesto:</p>
					<p>“Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man’s ideas, views, and conceptions, in one word, man’s consciousness, changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his social life?</p>
					<p>“What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production changes in character in proportion as material production is changed? The ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.⁠ ⁠…</p>
					<p>“When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the 18th century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death-battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience, merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge.⁠ ⁠…</p>
					<p>“The Communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; no wonder that this development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas.”</p>

					<p>At the time when the “Principles” were written, there existed practically no proletarlan parties anywhere. The political action of the incomparably small groups of Communists had to connect up with the actlvities of existing progressive political groups. Although all these groups were more or less dominated by bourgeois ideology, even the most proletarian⁠—the Chartist movement in England, yet these groups were revolutionary. Engels made it clear, however, that the Communists carry on independent politice from these movements and accompany them only so long as their roads may lay together.</p>
